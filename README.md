Note Taking
This is an application where users can capture quick thoughts, create checklists, sketch ideas, etc.

Creation of Note Taker:
This program was a mini project that I created. This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, and Heroku deployment. This is just a mini project I created to allow users to jot down notes or anything that comes to mind.
